## Implementation Plan

> **Strategy revision (2026-04-07):** Phases 4, 5, and 6 (infrastructure) are moved to the front.
> Rationale: every subsequent feature PR will automatically get the full CI pipeline, the
> C.L.E.A.R. PR template, and access to the agents. Building infrastructure last means the
> first 10+ PRs produce no rubric evidence for those categories.

---

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure: CI/CD + Agents + C.L.E.A.R. (Days 1–2, Apr 7–8)

**Branch: `chore/infrastructure`** — single PR, three areas.

#### 1a. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml` additions)

Add four new jobs to bring the pipeline from 3 stages to 8:

| New Job | What it does | Key config |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `e2e` | Runs Playwright tests headless after build | depends on `build`; installs browsers via `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` |
| `security` | `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` + Gitleaks secrets scan | fails PR if high/critical vuln or secret detected |
| `ai-review` | `claude-code-action` — Claude reviews the diff on every PR | triggers on `pull_request`; needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret |
| `perf-gate` | Lighthouse CI — LCP ≤ 2500ms, CLS ≤ 0.1 | uses `@lhci/cli`; requires `lighthouserc.js` config file; blocking from Sprint 3 |

Gitleaks runs as a step inside the `security` job using `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2`.

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — add 4 jobs
- `lighthouserc.js` — Lighthouse thresholds config (new file at repo root)

#### 1b. Claude Code Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

Create two agent definition files:

**`security-reviewer.md`**
- Purpose: When invoked, reads all changed API route files in the current PR/branch and checks each against the OWASP top 10 checklist in `docs/security.md`
- Specifically checks: Zod validation present, `supabase.auth.getUser()` called, role check for admin-only routes, no raw SQL string interpolation, no secrets in response bodies
- Output: a bullet-list of pass/fail findings per file

**`test-writer.md`**
- Purpose: Given a target (function name, file path, or issue number), generates the red-commit test file for the TDD cycle
- Reads the relevant ACs from `docs/acceptance-criteria.md` and the function signature from the source file
- Follows the exact test structure and naming conventions from existing `__tests__/` files
- Outputs a ready-to-commit test file — does NOT write the implementation

Both agents are invocable via `Agent` tool in future sessions, providing evidence of agent use in development workflow.

#### 1c. PR Template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)

Every PR opened after this merge auto-populates with:

```markdown
## What & Why
<!-- One sentence: what changed and the issue it closes -->
Closes #

## C.L.E.A.R. Review
- **Context:** <!-- what this PR does and why it matters -->
- **Logic:** <!-- key implementation decisions made -->
- **Edge cases:** <!-- what could go wrong or was explicitly handled -->
- **Assertions:** <!-- what the tests verify (link test file) -->
- **Risks:** <!-- anything that could break in production -->

## AI Disclosure
- **Tool:** Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6)
- **% AI-generated:** ~__%
- **Human review:** <!-- what you manually verified or changed -->

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests written before implementation (TDD red commit exists)
- [ ] `npm test` passes locally
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] No `console.log` left in committed code
- [ ] Zod validation on any new API route inputs
- [ ] Role check on any admin-only route
```

**Closes:** No issues — infrastructure only.
**PR title:** `chore: CI/CD pipeline upgrades, Claude agents, and C.L.E.A.R. PR template`

---

### Phase 2 — Sprint 2 Completion (Days 3–5, Apr 9–11)

Now that infrastructure is in place, all PRs from here forward get full CI + C.L.E.A.R. template + agent access.

Use **parallel worktrees** for both tracks — this also produces the worktree evidence required by the rubric.

**Track A: `feature/19-20-21-dashboard-risk-ui`**
- Dashboard: portfolio summary bar (green/amber/red counts)
- Dashboard: sort contracts red → amber → green
- Supplier list: risk roll-up badge (amber/red if any contract is amber/red)
- Tests: AC-06-4, AC-06-5
- Playwright E2E assertions for sort order and supplier badge
- Use `security-reviewer` agent before opening PR

**Track B: `feature/22-25-notifications`**
- Confirm `shouldSendAlert()` tests pass (lib/alerts.ts exists — verify coverage)
- Implement `GET /api/notifications` (unread only for current user)
- Implement `PUT /api/notifications/[id]` (mark as read)
- Notification bell in sidebar with live unread count
- Notifications page: replace mock data with real API
- Supabase Edge Function OR Next.js API route for daily threshold inserts
- Tests: AC-07-x (TDD red → green using `test-writer` agent for red commit)

**Worktree commands:**
```bash
git worktree add ../contracker-dashboard feature/19-20-21-dashboard-risk-ui
git worktree add ../contracker-notifications feature/22-25-notifications
# develop in parallel, open separate PRs, merge independently
git worktree remove ../contracker-dashboard
git worktree remove ../contracker-notifications
```

**Closes:** Issues #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #24, #25
**Then:** Issue #26 Sprint 2 QA PR

---

### Phase 3 — Sprint 3: Spend + Certifications (Days 6–8, Apr 12–14)

Use **parallel worktrees** again (second instance of parallel development for rubric evidence).

**Track A: `feature/28-29-spend`**
- TDD: `GET /api/spend` — totals by supplier and category, date filter
- Tests: AC-09-x (red → green; use `test-writer` agent for red commit)
- Spend page: supplier breakdown table + category table
- Recharts bar chart — top 10 suppliers (invoke `/chart-guide` skill)
- Year filter

**Track B: `feature/30-31-certifications`**
- TDD: `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/certifications`
- Certification status computed in app layer (valid/expiring/expired — 30 day window)
- Tests: AC-10-x (red → green)
- Compliance page: all suppliers with cert summary and traffic lights
- Supplier profile: add certification CRUD section
- Use `security-reviewer` agent before opening PR

**Closes:** Issues #28, #29, #30, #31

---

### Phase 4 — Sprint 3: Email Alerts + Team Invitation (Days 9–10, Apr 15–16)

**`feature/27-email-alerts`**
- Resend integration (requires `RESEND_API_KEY` in env)
- Edge Function or API route sends email at 60/30/7 thresholds
- Deduplication via `idx_notifications_unique` (no code guards needed)
- Tests: AC-08-x

**`feature/32-team-invitation`**
- Team settings page (`/settings/team`) — Admin only (403 for Member)
- `GET /api/team` — list org members
- `POST /api/team/invite` — Supabase Auth invite email
- `PUT /api/team/[id]` — promote/demote role
- Tests: AC-11-x

**Closes:** Issues #27, #32

---

### Phase 5 — Documentation (Days 11–13, Apr 17–19)

- **README:** Add Mermaid architecture diagram, deployment badge, test coverage badge
- **Blog post:** Publish on Medium or dev.to — focus on TDD workflow + Claude Code mastery insights
- **Individual reflection:** 500 words on Claude Code workflow insights (per partner)
- **Video demo:** 5–10 min screencast following W14 demo structure

---

### Phase 6 — Final QA + Security Audit (Days 14–15, Apr 20–22)

**Issue #33 — Branch: `chore/final-qa`**
- Full happy-path smoke test: Login → Contracts → Dashboard → Notifications → Spend → Compliance → Team
- Role audit: Member blocked from all Admin endpoints (automated tests confirm)
- OWASP checklist reviewed against live codebase (use `security-reviewer` agent)
- Lighthouse CI perf gate confirmed blocking
- Sentry + Better Uptime confirmed active
- Smoke test: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Showcase form submitted

---

## Worktree Command Reference

```bash
# Phase 2 parallel tracks
git worktree add ../contracker-dashboard feature/19-20-21-dashboard-risk-ui
git worktree add ../contracker-notifications feature/22-25-notifications

# Phase 3 parallel tracks
git worktree add ../contracker-spend feature/28-29-spend
git worktree add ../contracker-certifications feature/30-31-certifications

# Clean up after each phase
git worktree remove ../contracker-dashboard
git worktree remove ../contracker-notifications
```

---

## Open Decisions

1. **Notifications Edge Function** — real Supabase Edge Function vs. Next.js API route callable by cron
2. **Email alerts** — depends on `RESEND_API_KEY` being set; fallback is in-app only
3. **Team invitation** — depends on `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for Supabase Auth admin API
4. **C.L.E.A.R. on past PRs** — add comments to recent merged PRs retroactively?
5. **Test coverage threshold** — run `npm test -- --coverage` to verify current % before committing to 70% target

---
